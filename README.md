## :white_check_mark: Middlewares

I am a current student of the Ignite program presented by **[Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/)**.

Within every module, the course offers main challenges and extra assignments you can complete to enhance your skills and have fun.

This middleware creation task is one of the extra assignments offered to us. This task allowed me to practice even further the creation of middlewares to handle validations inside my API routes.

We were presented with a fully built API that contained the initial declaration for the middlewares. Our task was to read the project's specifications and develop the middlewares to perform the required validations. Rocketseat provided automated tests that can be executed to ensure no validations were missed and the code is 100% functional.
